Hello, I'm Amir Sartipi, a researcher and developer with a focus on AI, NLP applications, deep learning, and machine learning. With over six years of coding experience, including more than three years specialized in NLP, I've recently earned my Master's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Isfahan. My educational journey also includes a bachelor's degree from the same institution, solidifying my foundation in computer science.

Currently, I'm an NLP Engineer at both [Neuroship](https://neuroship.ai/) and [Viravirast](https://viravirast.com/), where I leverage cutting-edge techniques and multiple libraries to work on a broad spectrum of NLP subtasks. These include Named Entity Recognition (NER) in multilingual contexts, text classification, sequence labeling, machine translation, and working with Large Language Models (LLMs). My prior experience as a research assistant and a full-stack web developer has endowed me with an in-depth understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of technology, from research to application development. My work combines innovation and problem-solving, driven by my interests in data science, deep learning, and graph neural networks.
