Hi there! My name is Amir Sartipi, and I'm a researcher and developer with a focus on AI, NLP applications, deep learning, and machine learning. I have over two years of experience working in the NLP field. I'm currently in the final stages of completing my master's degree in computer science at the University of Isfahan, where I also earned my bachelor's degree in the same field.

As a research assistant at the University of Isfahan and an NLP developer at Vira Virast, I'm always looking for new and innovative ways to use technology to solve complex problems. With three years of experience as a full-stack web developer, I've also gained a deep understanding of the software development process.

In my research and development work, I'm particularly interested in data science, deep learning, and graph neural networks. Over the past two years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of NLP projects.
