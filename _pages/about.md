Hi there! My name is Amir Sartipi, and I'm a researcher and developer with a focus on AI, NLP applications, deep learning, and machine learning. I'm currently in the final stages of completing my master's degree in computer science at the University of Isfahan, where I also earned my bachelor's degree in the same field.

As a research assistant at the University of Isfahan and an NLP developer at Vira Virast, I'm always looking for new and innovative ways to use technology to solve complex problems. With three years of experience as a full-stack web developer, I've also gained a deep understanding of the software development process.

In my research and development work, I'm particularly interested in data science, deep learning, and graph neural networks. I've been fortunate enough to contribute to the development of advanced NLP models and lead several research projects. It's incredibly rewarding to be able to use my skills and knowledge to make a real difference in the world.
